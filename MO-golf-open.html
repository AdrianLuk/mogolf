                    <strong>New for 2018...introducing a Scramble format in addition to our traditional Open format!</strong>
                </p>
                <p>During registration on line or with Zlatka, you can now chose between 2 playing format options. One is our
                    traditional “Open” format where you play your own ball and compete against other open format players
                    for the Macedonian Open winners trophies. The second option is a “Scramble” format where your pick the
                    best shot of your foursome and all players play their next shot from that player’s ball position. The
                    Scramble format foursomes will compete against other scramble foursomes for the new Scramble winner trophy.</p>
                <p>The Scramble format is being introduced to encourage more participation in the fun and camaraderie of the
                    Macedonian Open, while maintaining the 76 year tradition and history of the Open format. If you are a
                    casual player, a less serious player, a beginner, or simply interested in a having a great time with
                    your friends without worrying about your score, the Scramble format is the right choice for you. Pick
                    your option!
